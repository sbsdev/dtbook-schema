* dtbook-schema

This project extends the [[https://daisy.org/guidance/info-help/guidance-training/standards/daisy-structure-guidelines/][DTBook]] schema with elements and attributes
needed for (Swiss) German Braille production.

** How to build

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
mvn package
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+begin_src shell
  mvn release:clean release:prepare -DdryRun=true
  mvn release:prepare
  mvn release:perform -Darguments="-Dmaven.deploy.skip=true"
#+end_src

*** Security Manager is deprecated

Unfortunately, you have to use Java 17 to build the dtbook schema ATM.
With more recent Java versions the build fails with "The Security
Manager is deprecated and will be removed in a future release".
